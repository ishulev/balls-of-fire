h3 Story about me
p Even though, in our society, we try to separate the professional from the personal, it feels like they should go hand in hand. It does not sound logical to grow as a professional without growing spiritually. I realize that the people around me tend to value more and strive for the former at the cost of the latter.
p At this point in my life, I don't see the need to have a 9 to 5 job, mainly because what you do should be an expression of yourself. Such an expression can occur for more than 8 hours one day, less than 3 in the other and it could occur while in bathtub, on the bus, on the beach or basically anywhere. It happens for a reason and it is the responsibility of the developer to translate that into his art (yes, I believe that web developers are artists!).
p For the above reasons and more, I will embark on a journey of exploration and, hopefully personal realization and growth. I will leave the comfort zone of Europe and my job in Amsterdam and go to Asia. I will start with Bangkok, with my dear friend Tomas [insert link] and will stay there for a month. After that, we are off to Balli for another month and then I plan to go my separate way, in order to have a personal and enlightening experience.
p It doesn't sound logical, but it feels like I am following my heart so I will go through with this and keep notes about my journey, so I might even start a blog.
