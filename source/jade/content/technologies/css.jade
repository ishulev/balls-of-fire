h3 CSS
p When I began introducing myself to different web technologies, I was really into JavaScript for the awesome animations jQuery had in its arsenal. The more I got into it, the more I realized that CSS is perfectly capable of handling that and even in a more efficient way [insert link about comparing CSS to JS when it comes to CPU intensity]. With every new project I do, I strive to rely on CSS, as much as I can. More and more awesome features are added to CSS and are gradually getting adopted by browser vendors, so the time to invest in CSS3 is now. Another awesome thing about it is the integrated graceful degradation[insert link]. If a browser does not support a certain rule, it will simply fall back to the last known one, or will not show the styling effect. If used with caution, this could increase productivity time and release the developer from some legacy browser support worries.
