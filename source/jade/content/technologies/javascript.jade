h3 JavaScript
p The language that has it all [insert link].
p When I started meddling with this language, I used it for simple DOM manipulations. It was simple jQuery code for adding animations, but it didn't feel like anything special. The more interesting part was PHP (the first language I used for server scripting). I had the idea that this was a “full-featured” language, compared to JavaScript. I didn't feel the need to explore the capabilities of it, when the back-end could do it all for me. At the second semester of my studies, I had to do some exercises with Vanilla JS. That was the first time I started realizing the potential of the language.
p The concept of AJAX, which I got introduced to later on, blew my mind. The idea that partials of the page could be updated, without reloading the whole application seemed like future technology.
p This was the time when my focus started shifting from the all mighty back-end to the potentially greater front-end (I do realize that there is no objective comparison). One of the last semesters of my studies, I got introduced to AngularJS. At first, I didn't see the need for the complexity it had, but I kept going with it, regardless. The deeper I went with it, the more I realized the benefits for following the framework practices. I am constantly learning new concepts about development in general and it is making me into a better programmer. Thank you Angular[insert link]!
