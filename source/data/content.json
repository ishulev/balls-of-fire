			"front-end": "<p>I do believe that, as with everything in life, web development is a constant learning process. I once thought that front-end was the easiest of a 3-layered model that I had in my head, regarding programming. The second level was back-end and the most complex – software development.</p><p>I was associating front-end with HTML, styled with CSS, optionally sprinkled with a little JavaScript magic for DOM manipulations. The back-end was where the real logic was laying. Back in the day, that may used to be the case [insert link]. Ultimately, the culmination in complexity was building a desktop application. Therefore, the plan was simple – don't pay too much attention to the simple stuff (the first layer), but enough to build a website. Focus more on the server script, because it would ultimately prepare me for the real deal – software development. So everything I did was just to get me closer to that ultimate goal. The reason for me waning to be a software developer was  the perceived title and the possible salary (in my head a software developer was better than a web developer in both social status and renumeration).</p><p>In my pursuit for the possible gain, I failed to enjoy the present moment of learning how to code with web technologies. A client-side application can be as complex as I want it to be and with the advancement of technologies, websites and desktop programs become more and more indistinguishable in the functionality they do and the user experience they deliver.</p>"
